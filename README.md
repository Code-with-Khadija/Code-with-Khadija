I’m **Khadija Ijaz**, an **Artificial Intelligence undergraduate (Junior year)**

I love to **explore, design, and build intelligent systems** that solve real-world problems using AI and automation.

If an idea involves **AI agents, automation, or smart workflows**, chances are I’ll experiment with it and try to turn it into a working system.

I’m currently working on **Agentic AI**, using **LangChain and LangGraph**, along with **Vector Databases** and **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** to build context-aware and decision-driven AI systems.

I actively build **AI automation workflows** using **n8n, Make.com, and Zapier**, and work on **AI-powered calling and voice systems** with **Twilio, ElevenLabs, and Retell AI**.

My go-to backend tools include **Python, Flask, FastApi**, and SQL-based databases like **MySQL and SQLite**, along with **Neo4j** for graph-based systems.

Currently focused on **deepening my understanding of advanced AI systems**, agent workflows, and scalable AI solutions.
